This repository contains the code for [**QuaRot**: Outlier-Free 4-Bit Inference in Rotated LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456).



## Abstract
We introduce QuaRot, a new **Qua**ntization scheme based on **Rot**ations, which is able to quantize LLMs end-to-end, including all weights, activations, and KV cache in 4 bits. QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This *computational invariance* is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4-bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision. Our quantized **LLaMa2-70B** model has losses of at most **0.29 WikiText perplexity** and retains **99% of the zero-shot** performance.
